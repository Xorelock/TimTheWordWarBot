Build notes

Building timmy requires that you have the following jar dependencies on your classpath:

- pircbot.jar (provided in this bundle)

- Apache commons configuration:
http://commons.apache.org/configuration/download_configuration.cgi
The code seems to compile on commons configuration version 1.7

- Apache commons lang:
http://commons.apache.org/lang/download_lang.cgi
The code does -NOT- compile on lang v3.0.1, however i've succeeded in compiling against version 2.6
